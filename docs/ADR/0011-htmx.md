# 11. Htmx

Date: 2024-08-20

## Status

Accepted

## Context

For an interactive user interface in the web, Javascript is inevitable. As this is a very small project, for now mainly written and supported by a single person,
we want to aim for the maximum of technical simplicity.

## Decision

We will use the library "htmx" to provide an interactive user interface for the user.

## Consequences
- Django urls, views and templates will be tightly coupled with htmx so there is a strong dependency to htmx
- the dependency to htmx could be reduced by implementing a fall-back (e.g. when javascript is deactivated in the user's browser)
- the whole project-code stays in one single repository (compared to a separate front-end)
- using hypermedia as the engine of application state (HATEOAS) as central concept of the (internal) structure
- the project will stay a standard Django "multi-page application" (MPA) instead of a JSON-Data-Provider coupled with a SPA-Frontend
