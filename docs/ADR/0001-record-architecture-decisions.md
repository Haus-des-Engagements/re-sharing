# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2024-03-12

## Status

Accepted

## Context

In long-lasting projects, it is sometime difficult to understand why certain choices have been made.
A core component of making good decisions is understanding the rationale behind previous decisions. If we don’t 
understand how we got “here,” we run the risk of making things much worse (also known as Chesterton's fence).

To help in this matter, we want to record the architectural decisions made in this project. 

## Decision

We will shortly describe each main architecture decision, using the Architecture Decision Records, 
as [described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

## Consequences

See Michael Nygard's article, linked above. For a lightweight ADR toolset, see Nat Pryce's [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools).
