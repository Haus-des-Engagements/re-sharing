# 5. Cookiecutter-Django

Date: 2024-03-12

## Status

Accepted

## Context

After we have decided to use Django in ADR 0004, we need to think about the project setup. This includes the different
settings or the use of third-party frameworks.

We were influenced by the book "Two Scoops of Django" (Best practices for the Django web framework). The authors of the
book also implemented Cookiecutter-Django (https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django), following their best 
practices layed out in "Two Scoops".

Django also has the command startproject to establish a projects structure. The generated project structure of
startproject is much simpler than the Cookiecutter-Django setup but hurts some security guidelines and best practices
(like the [12-factor-app](https://12factor.net/) )and is less documented.

## Decision

We use the Cookiecutter-Django to initialise our project. We used the instructions and the code from
https://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/. We remove unused things.

## Consequences

* We need to remove all unneeded additional code from Cookiecutter-Django.
* In general, the consequences are little because we can manually change all files generated by Cookiecutter-Django.
We do not depend on further developement of Cookiecutter-Django.
* We follow loosely the way of doing described in "Two Scoops of Django".
